####Exoplanet Visualizer

#####This basic example of D3.js in action takes data from the ExoAPI, a database of information about planets discovered outside of our solar system, and visualizes the rate at which exoplanets are discovered over time.

#####The takeaway here should be that we are discovering new exoplanets at an exponential rate. The rate of discovery in the late-eighties and early nineties was about one per year, whereas in 2011 we discovered around 170 new exoplanets.
